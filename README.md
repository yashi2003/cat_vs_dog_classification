# cat vs dog classification
# Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
Dataset Details:
you can download dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats/data)

Dataset Description:
Dataset contain 25k images of Cats and Dogs, 
we will TRAIN our model on 20k images,
in which 10k images of cats and 10k images of dogs

Validation Images of Cats = 2.5k
Validation Images of Dogs = 2.5k

# Overfiting aviodence Techniques Used:
1-Batch Normalization
2-Dropout
